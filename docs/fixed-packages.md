# Fixed Packages

Fixed packages allow you to specify a group or groups of packages that should be versioned and published together.

> Unlike `linked packages`, all packages in the group of fixed packages will be version-bumped and published together even when there are no changes done to some of the the member packages.

## Examples

I have three packages, `pkg-a`, `pkg-b` and `pkg-c`. `pkg-a` and `pkg-b` are fixed but `pkg-c` is not so the config looks like this.

```json
{
  "fixed": [["pkg-a", "pkg-b"]]
}
```

- `pkg-a` is at `1.0.0`
- `pkg-b` is at `1.0.0`
- `pkg-c` is at `1.0.0`

I have a changeset with a patch for `pkg-a`, minor for `pkg-b` and major for `pkg-c` and I do a release, the resulting versions will be:

- `pkg-a` is at `1.1.0`
- `pkg-b` is at `1.1.0`
- `pkg-c` is at `2.0.0`

I now have another changeset with a minor for `pkg-a` and I do a release, the resulting versions will be:

- `pkg-a` is at `1.2.0`
- `pkg-b` is at `1.2.0`
- `pkg-c` is at `2.0.0`

## Using glob expressions

Sometimes you want to fix many or all packages within your project (for example in a monorepo setup), in which case you would need to keep the list of fixed packages up-to-date.

To make it simpler to maintain that list, you can provide glob expressions in the list that would match and resolve to all the packages that you wish to include.

For example:

```json
{
  "fixed": [["pkg-*"]]
}
```

It will match all packages starting with `pkg-`.

**The glob expressions must be defined according to the [micromatch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/micromatch) format.**

## Single Changelog Group

If you want to produce a single changelog for a fixed package group, use an object in your configuration like so:

```json
{
  "fixed": [
    {
      "group": ["pkg-a", "pkg-b", "pkg-c"],
      "changelog": "CHANGELOG.md",
      "name": "My Stuff"
    }
  ]
}
```

For example, if I have a changeset with a patch for pkg-a, a second changeset with a minor for pkg-b, and third changeset with a major for pkg-a and pkg-c and I do a release, the resulting changelog will be:

```
# My Stuff

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- [1234567] **(pkg-a, pkg-c)** Lorem ipsum.

### Minor Changes

- [2345678] **(pkg-b)** Blah blah.

### Patch Changes

- [3456789] **(pkg-a)** Something something.
```

Should I have another changeset that mixes packages and version types, such as a changeset for a patch for pkg-a and a major for pkg-b, the highest version type will win, resulting in a changelog entry like:

```
## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- [4567890] **(pkg-a, pkg-b)** Lorem ipsum.
```
